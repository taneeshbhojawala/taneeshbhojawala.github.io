Thank you for visiting my website.Please share this website with your friends.
You can be in contact with me at **taneeshbhojawala@gmail**.
This is a website for my **Electronics** projects and programms for **Arduino**.
We are going to make ***robots*** using **Arduino**.
We will also do circuiting without using *Arduino*.
We will have a *lot of fun* doing these project.

I will teach you how to make a circuit on a breadboard and then making the circuit on **PCB**.
I will also teach you to make circuits on a circuit making software **EAGLE**.
Well, to make a circuit on ***PCB*** we need to do soldering. If you don't know to solder components, I will teach you that too.
Common, lets start!!!!!

**WHAT IS THIS ?**


This is the **arduino uno**.
We will use this arduino and make the projects.
I will even help you make ***3d printers***.We can build such types of printers.

# PROJECTS
  1. **3d printers**



Well, so what are 3d printers?

So a 3d printer is a printer which prints 3d objects with a plastic called filament.
It prints the objects layer by layer.
If you have a 3d printer, I would recommend you to use **Rihnoceros 3d moddeling software**.
For converting the model in layers and set the settings, I would recommend you to use **Cura**.

Well,for making **3d printers** at home without any costly kit, you will need arduino mega and some more components.This is the ***Arduino mega***.

I will surly post a vedio on youtube to show how to make a *3d printer*.
But before we start to make a 3d printer,we will do some simple projects using **arduino** and simple circuiting on ***PCB***.
